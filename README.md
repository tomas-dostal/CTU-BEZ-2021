# FIT CTU BI-BEZ course

Even though my results were not 100%, at least I can tell that I tried. In most cases.

- [Task 1 - Mathematica](./task1_mathematica) 2/2
- [Task 2 - Hash](./task2_hash) 3/3
- [Task 3 - Block](./task3_block) 5/5 
- [Task 4 - Asymetric](./task4_asymmetric) 5/5 + 1 bonus (50% penalisation for late submission)
- [Task 5 - Certificates](./task5_certificates) 0/5. It was a wounderful sunny day

## Copying

I strongly discourage you from copying the code from this repository. This is not a good example how source code should look like. You were warned. 

If you are still willing to proceed, just take a look, but don't copy it. Try to understand the code and then write it yourself. Taking inspiration is mostly OK, but be careful how deeply you inspire. It might help you at the moment, but in the long term, it will just harm you. Plus, multiple courses @ CTU have an anti-cheating mechanism, so it might cause you more troubles than skipping the task and just going out with friends. 

It might not be easy, but you are here to acquire knowledge and if you'd wanted it by the easy way, you wouldn't have chosen FIT CTU. Have fun!
